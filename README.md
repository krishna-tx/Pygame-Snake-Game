# Creating a Snake Game using Pygame

In this project, I used the Pygame library and Object Oriented Programming with Python to create a replica of the famous snake game. I found myself playing this game online when I was bored so I decided to create a copy as a way to learn and test myself on my coding skills.

To play the game, run the Python file and use the arrow keys or w, a, s, and d keys to move the snake. Make sure not to go out of bounds or hit yourself or else the game will end!

The "highscore.txt" file is used to keep the high score in memory.
